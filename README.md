# DeepL-Keras-CNN-with-SVM

This project demonstrates the integration of Support Vector Machine (SVM) with Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification tasks. By combining these two powerful techniques, the model aims to leverage the feature extraction capabilities of CNNs and the classification strength of SVMs.
